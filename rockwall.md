# Building the living room bouldering wall
A bouldering wall is basically a floor that runs vertically, and ends up
getting framed the same way. I didn't have a background in construction, but I
did have the [Metolius
guide](http://www.metoliusclimbing.com/pdf/How-to-Build-a-Home-Climbing-Wall.pdf)
and [an accomplice](http://joycetipping.com). I sketched up a rough model of
the wall in Blender, along with some relevant house structure from the
architectural drawings:

## Basic design constraints + framing
The project wasn't entirely straightforward for a few reasons:

1. I didn't want to remove any drywall; the bouldering wall needed to be
   removable, modulo a few holes.
2. There's a baseboard heater running the length of the main wall, so the
   entire structure is hanging rather than supported from the floor.
3. The house is split-level and the main wall is backed by concrete and/or
   interior wiring below 54" (so all supporting hardware needs to be above this
   level).
4. The bouldering wall has a ceiling-mounted section, but I don't want to hang
   weight on the ceiling; instead, it's transferred down the diagonal.

I started out by installing a ridiculously overengineered 2x6 frame over the
studs in the wall. Each 2x6 has three lag bolts in the top half, and the bottom
half hangs. (This is structurally sound due to the tensile strength of wood
parallel to the grain.)

The ceiling section is also lagged into the structure, which is 12" OC 2x12 and
supports the flat roof directly. Ultimately, though, the load gets transferred
down the diagonal after about 1/4" of deflection.

Here's the top receiver for the diagonals. I had tried assembling the five 2x6
sections as a single piece, but it was too heavy to hold against the ceiling
while drilling the bolt holes. Ended up doing it piece by piece and assembling
once the ceiling boards were in place.

Installed diagonals, which interestingly aren't fastened in any way. The joist
hangers and routed slots in the main 2x6s hold them in place, and I figured any
fasteners would only weaken the structure. I didn't take any pictures of the
bottom diagonal receivers -- but they're routed 3/4" into the main boards so
the diagonals rest on the wood grain; the joist hangers on the bottom don't
take much load. (Also, 2x6 for the diagonal framing was way overkill in
hindsight.)

## Paneling
It's common to use 3/4" plywood for the climbing surface, but that stuff is
expensive and I wanted to try using OSB instead.
