      rather than absolute coordinates. I wrote a Perl script to let you insert
      absolute and relative offsets into your conkyrc to get arbitrary
      positioning for each element.

      <h1>The Safety Ladder</h1>
      <p>
      Evaporative coolers require a lot of maintenance, and I like having roof
      access in general. So rather than dragging out the regular ladder, I
      built one onto the side of the house using some old deck wood and
      carriage bolts. Nothing is permanently mounted; the top is held in place
      with a wooden lever clamp and the weight is transferred straight to the
      ground. Writeup pending...

      <h1>Right-handed prompt indicators for bash</h1>
      <p>
      zsh users are understandably fond of right-hand prompt indicators, but it
      turns out that you can do the same thing in bash with a bit of escape
      character trickery.
