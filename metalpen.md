# Machining a pen from A36 steel round
Metalworking tools change a lot of life equations about what's expensive. Having
sunk a small fortune into building out a machine shop, and having lost a $30
metal pen on a plane flight, I figured it would be cheaper to use a few inches
of 1/2" steel round than buy another one.

This isn't entirely wrong, but it's a long way from right.

## The finished product
This was my fourth attempt. I managed to break the first three during
manufacture in various ways. (**TODO:** upload some photos of those)

### What works
1. It feels great to write with, once you get used to the weight.
2. The knurl texture is awesome.
3. Aside from the cap, there's no looseness anywhere; the refill feels like it
   was welded in.
4. The pen is wide enough that you can stand it on end (including with the cap
   off). I consider this a feature, even though I can't imagine a practical use
   for it.

### What doesn't work
1. The cap has no retention mechanism; I ended up winding some teflon tape
   around the receiver to add enough thickness to keep it on. Every now and then
   I replace the tape because it wears out.
2. There's a defect on the side of the pen: I milled the slot too deep, and it
   cut into the threads on the inside. I admit it does look cool though.
3. Along those lines, the milled track slot is rough around the edges; it looks
   amateur.
4. You have to use a vise and pliers to replace the refill.
5. It's round and heavy, so it rolls easily.

## Planning the next one
I want to change a few things:

1. The cap should screw onto the end of the pen.
2. The barrel and cap should have a hex profile so it doesn't roll.
3. I think the diameter could be a little bit smaller, but I'm running tight
   tolerances between the hex flats and the internal threads. (I'm just using
   regular M7/M8 taps; there's probably a finer thread profile that would work
   better.)

## TODO: manufacturing process
I need to write this up, but I didn't document it while I was making it. I'll
probably get some photo/video docs of the next one.
